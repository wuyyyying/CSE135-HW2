## Experience with PHP and NodeJS
PHP seems to be more modular as individual tasks are usually written in separate php files. On the other hand, the majority of NodeJS code is located in nodes.js file. Though it doesn’t mean that we can’t write JavaScript in separate file -- we can always write different files handling different tasks and then call sendfile in nodes.js. However, dealing with different requests through express in Node.js seems to be easier and more concise, as all the requests handling part can be written in a function in the same file. So overall PHP is easier for a single task/program as you just write a few files and don't need to bring up a running server again, but it can be tedious if we have multiple tasks to do. Node.js on the other hand might seem to require more work as you need to bring up that server, but you can store all programs in one file and is slightly more efficient when you have more tasks. 


For now, we think we can use PHP as our analytic backend, but if it requires us to be more efficient, we will switch to Node.js.
